module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: '#3B82F6',    // Blue

        // Add your custom colors
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Adding New Features:
1. Create a new component in `src/components/`
2. Add the component to the navigation in `App.tsx`
3. Define any new types in `src/types/index.ts`

## 📊 Sample Data

The application comes with sample data to help you understand how it works:
- Sample students with different attendance records
- Example classes for Computer Science department
- Mock attendance data for demonstration

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

1. **Port already in use**: If port 5173 is busy, Vite will automatically use the next available port
2. **Node version issues**: Make sure you're using Node.js 16 or higher
3. **Dependencies not installing**: Try deleting `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again
